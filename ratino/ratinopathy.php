            <i><p style="text-align:justify;color:white;">
            Over time, the damaged blood vessels can leak fluid and blood into the retina, leading to swelling and the formation of deposits called exudates. In some cases, new abnormal blood vessels may also grow on the surface of the retina, a condition known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These new blood vessels are fragile and can easily break and bleed, further impairing vision.</p>

                <li style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Blurred or fluctuating vision.</li>
                <li style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Seeing dark or empty areas in the field of vision.</li>
                <li style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Impaired color vision.</li>
                <li style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Difficulty reading or seeing fine details.</li>
                <li style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Floaters, which are small specks or spots that seem to float across the field of vision.</li>
                <li style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Sudden vision loss in severe cases.</li>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;color:white;">Diabetic retinopathy is more likely to occur in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes or those who have had diabetes for a long time. Other factors that increase the risk include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, pregnancy, and tobacco use. 
            Regular eye examinations are crucial for individuals with diabetes to detect and manage diabetic retinopathy in its early stages. Treatment options may include laser therapy to seal leaking blood vessels, medications to reduce swelling or inhibit the growth of abnormal blood vessels, and in severe cases, surgery may be necessary.
            It's important for people with diabetes to maintain good control of their blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol to reduce the risk of developing or worsening diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, leading a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and not smoking, can also help in managing the condition.

            <h2 style="color:white;"><b>There are two main types of diabetic retinopathy:</b></h2>

<br><p style="text-align:justify;color:white;"><b>Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR):</b><i> In this early stage, small blood vessels in the retina leak fluid or blood, leading to swelling or the formation of deposits called exudates. NPDR may not cause any noticeable symptoms initially.</i></p>

<br><p style="text-align:justify;color:white;"><b>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR):</b><i> In advanced stages, the damaged blood vessels in the retina trigger the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels. These new vessels are fragile and can bleed into the vitreous, the gel-like substance that fills the center of the eye. This bleeding can result in severe vision loss.</i></p>
</h3>
<h3 style="color:white;"><b>Precautions</b></h3>
            <p class="fst-italic" style="text-align:justify;">
            <li style="color:white;text-align:justify;"><i>Regular medical check-ups: If you have diabetes, it's crucial to undergo regular eye examinations, at least once a year or as recommended by your healthcare provider. Early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy can significantly improve the outcome.</i></li>
            <li style="color:white;text-align:justify;"><i>Good diabetes management: Maintain stable blood sugar levels through healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, and appropriate medication or insulin therapy. By controlling your blood sugar, you can reduce the risk and severity of diabetic retinopathy.</i></li>
            <li style="color:white;text-align:justify;"><i>Blood pressure and cholesterol control: Manage your blood pressure and cholesterol levels as high blood pressure and cholesterol can exacerbate the damage caused by diabetic retinopathy.</i></li>
            <li style="color:white;text-align:justify;"><i>Quit smoking: Smoking can further increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy and other diabetes-related complications. Quitting smoking is beneficial for both your overall health and your eye health.</i></li>
            <li style="color:white;text-align:justify;"><i>Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Adopt a well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy weight, as these factors contribute to overall diabetes management.</i></li>
            <li style="color:white;text-align:justify;"><i>Monitor for symptoms: Be vigilant for any changes in your vision, such as blurry or distorted vision, floaters, or dark spots. Report any concerns to your healthcare provider promptly.</i></li>
